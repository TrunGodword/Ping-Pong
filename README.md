This here is just a random Ping Pong game I made on my own to grasp the basics of Pyglet while also figuring out how most of the basic principles of games work in general. 
Said principles being:
- Movement
- Collision
- AI
- Implementation of win condition etc.

Though I doubt there really is more to it at all beyond that. It'll be quite a while until I can put out some stuff that's actually original and, well, fun.
